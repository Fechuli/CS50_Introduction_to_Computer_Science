# CS50x 2023 Introduction to Computer Science

Within this repository are solutions to all the exercises I have done during the duration of the course.
Free to take cues and inspiration.

> Keep [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/) in mind.

Each exercise is accompanied by an explanation of how I arrived at the resolution.
Clearly, the explanations relate only to the problem sets since the labs already have their own in-depth solutions.
