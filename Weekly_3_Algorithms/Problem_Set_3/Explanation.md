In the third week, I could not enter the Lab. Sorry.

# [Plurality](https://github.com/Fechuli/CS50x_2023_Introduction_to_Computer_Science/blob/main/Weekly_3_Algorithms/Problem_Set_3/plurality.c)

Plurality is an interesting exercise that allows us to determine a multi-person election winner.
It is an exercise that I have commented on a lot unlike others so you find the explanation directly in the code.

# [Runoff](https://github.com/Fechuli/CS50x_2023_Introduction_to_Computer_Science/blob/main/Weekly_3_Algorithms/Problem_Set_3/runoff.c)

This ranks third in the exercises that gave me the most pain. 
Like the previous one and well annotated so it will not be chaotic while reading.
