In the third week, I could not enter the Lab. Sorry.

# [Plurality]()

Plurality is an interesting exercise that allows us to determine a multi-person election winner.
It is an exercise that I have commented on a lot unlike others so you find the explanation directly in the code.

# [Runoff]()

This ranks third in the exercises that gave me the most pain. 
Like the previous one and well annotated so it will not be chaotic while reading.
