Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

By increasing the number of simulations,
predictions of the probability of teams winning become more accurate,
reducing the possibility of incorrect predictions.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Given the times and results obtained I believe that this the good enough depends on the number of N.
The higher the number of N the more attempts I will have to make to reach a decent response.
It is also true that I will not be charged any fee up to 1000000 N so I could test freely without worrying.
