# DNA

Okay, the last exercise is the first original exercise of the lesson. Crazy stuff.
Dna is a pretty complex exercise (it was a mess), I'll explain.

Basically, our goal is to open a database (CSV files) and read the information from it, then read strings of "DNA" entered in other files that open in the same way.
What the program goes to do is a comparison. Based on the equality of the string, the name of the person with the same DNA will be printed or not.
Pyhton is definitely simpler than C. Even though the logics are pretty much the same it allows you to write them in an easier way. Almost playful. In any case, I'm interested to see how it can be applied in slightly more working circumstances.
