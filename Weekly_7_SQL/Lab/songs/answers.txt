It is evident that music evolves over time.
For example, we can see that the maximum danceability in the 1970s were songs that hardly exceeded 120 BPM.
Currently the standard is around 130 but I would dwell on the way music evolves.
The time range proposed by the exercise is only a few years so the "generational change" has not yet taken place.
If I were to take a look at the current(2023) Spotify ranking I don't see too much difference. The average has remained more or less the same.
Spotify's aura is a concept that is quite far away from me. It hardly fits but because I trivially don't listen to Spotify much.
As a result, Spotify has less information gathered within its databases and gives a rough answer.
If a user is determined to have an aura that actually matches his or her persona he or she should listen
to a lot more music and a lot longer especially so as to "train" Spotify to his or her personality.
