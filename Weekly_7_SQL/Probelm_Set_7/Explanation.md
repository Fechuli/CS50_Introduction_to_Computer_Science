The lesson on SQL was one of the most interesting and fun, perhaps my favorite.
I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

# [Movies]()

So, this exercise puts us in front of a database from IMDb. It contains several pieces of information.
We should not write real code, but we should ask the database questions and expect answers.

The output will be 13 sql files in which the statements for each of the queries in the 'exercise will be given.
I won't go into detail, they are all pretty simple but useful for a thorough understanding of how SQL works.

# [FiftyVille]()

In FiftyVille we play detective. 
A very challenging exercise that, in my opinion, doesn't stray far from reality and the methodology by which some cases are solved.

They stole the cs50's duck. 
It's our job to figure out who the culprit is. 
The exercise itself is an argument about how you came to the conclusion so you'll just have to read my log.sql file to see how I figured out the bad guy.
