-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Humphrey Street bakery.
-- Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€“ each of their interview transcripts mentions the bakery.

-- It's time to take a look at the interviews

SELECT transcript, name, year FROM interviews;
SELECT transcript, name, day FROM interviews WHERE month = 7;

-- Digging through the interviews I managed to retrieve three interesting ones which I transcribe below.

-- Barbara says: Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
--               If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- Ruth says:    I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
--               I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- Eugene says:  As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
--               In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
--               The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

-- Ruth talks about ATM on Legget Street. Maybe i can check the operations.
-- Barbara talks about bakery parking and security footage.
-- Eugene talks about the fact that the thief would take the first flight out of Fiftyville 29/07.

-- Let's start with Ruth.

-- We finally have a square of the situation.
-- Bruce is clearly the thief as he is present in all 4 lists I analyzed.
-- Robin was the accomplice who bought the ticket for Bruce.
-- His intent was to fly to New York and get away with it.
-- Unfortunately for him, we are here to foil his plans.
