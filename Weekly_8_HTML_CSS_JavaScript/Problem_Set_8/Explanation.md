I was born as a web developer, and in this section I wanted to say a lot of things explaining how the simple website I made works.  
Unfortunately, I realize it's so simple that it limits the things I can explain. 

To give a brief recap. 

There are 4 html pages. Each of them contains the same menu so that you can navigate between them quickly and easily. 
We are required to use bootstrap.
I personally prefer [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), but I think it is a matter of habit.

The project contains a small css file that contains a few lines of code. I used the * selector to change the font family of all my writing in Montserrat.
I retrieved the font at [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) and imported it into the first line of the .css file.

There is some script in javascript. Simple stuff. 
I thought about the background of the page changing and a nice alert when my face is clicked.

The page is about me so there is pretty much the basic information that is in most portfolios.
